# Mario-2d-Game-Processing
it's an Unfinished Mario 2d game made with Processing,  that I did in July (Used POO )I'm putting this here to remind myself to finish it. I made the whole template of the game ( the background, contraints, points ect.. ) , the template of the different  movements of Mario ( when he's jumping , walking and every minor detail) , I have to finish the lives and the score and the colusion between him and the constraints. :)
